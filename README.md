# periqles-demo
A demo for [periqles](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/periqles/blob/main/README.md), a form library for Relay and Apollo.

[See it deployed â†’](https://periqles.herokuapp.com/)

This repo uses Relay and Apollo clients side-by-side on the same Express server to demonstrate how to use periqles in either client. As such, it's a little bootstrappy on the backend; your own backend will probably look very different. Please consult [the periqles readme](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/periqles/blob/main/README.md) for an overview of the library.

If there's anything else about periqles you'd like to see demonstrated, please write an [issue](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/periqles-demo/issues) or open a pull request.
